### Problem

<span style="text-align: center; font-style:italic">(This is kinda trash because the threshold kind of lmao)</span>
### Can we do this better
- Focus on the edge of each cluster and use the mid point between them

![[Pasted image 20240304225453.png|825]]
 - <span style="color:#ff0000">Margin</span>: Shortest distance between the observation and the threshold

 - <span style="color:#ff0000"><span style="color: #f00000">Maximal Margin Classifier</span></span>: When we use the threshold that give us the largest margin to make classifications
